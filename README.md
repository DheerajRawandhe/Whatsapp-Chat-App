## Whatsapp-Chat-App
I created a WhatsApp Chat App using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. This project allows users to send and receive real-time messages. Each message is stored in the database with user details, message content, time, and date. 


The backend is built using Node.js and Express, which handle server-side operations efficiently. MongoDB is used to manage and store user data and chat messages.

One of the key features of this Project is the display of timestamps with each message, giving users clear information about when each message was sent and received. The app also includes a user-friendly interface designed using HTML, CSS, and EJS templates, making it easy for users to navigate and Chat effortlessly.
